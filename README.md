# Data Structure Assignment: The Battle of Red Cliff Simulation
## Introduction
This project simulates key strategic aspects of The Battle of Red Cliff, a decisive event during the Three Kingdoms period in Chinese history. Using data structures and algorithms, it implements various features to help the Wu Kingdom strategize and defeat Cao Cao's forces.

## Features
### Basic Features
1. Wu Kingdom Hierarchy:
Build a three-level tree hierarchy.
Automate assignment of generals to military or management departments based on attributes.2

2. Generals Sorting and Selection:
Sort generals by attributes such as strength, leadership, or intelligence.
Use binary search to suggest the best team based on ability levels.

3. Arrow Borrowing Simulation:
Maximize captured arrows using efficient boat direction and straw men placement.

4. Enemy Fortress Attack Simulation:
Use breadth-first search (BFS) to identify all possible paths to enemy camps.

5. Food Harvesting Path Optimization:
Find the shortest path to collect food from all nodes while avoiding unnecessary stops.

6. Encrypted Communication:
Implement a Caesar cipher for secure text communication.

### Advanced Features
1. Dynamic Simulations:
Redesign arrow borrowing for random input and limited straw men uses.

2. Optimized Fireball Attack:
Determine optimal coordinates for maximum burning efficiency.

3. Enhanced Text Encryption:
Use custom or advanced encryption algorithms for secure communication.

4. Shortest Path with Geographical Constraints:
Optimize travel time considering terrain types such as flat roads, forests, and swamps.

### Extra Features
1. Graphical User Interface (GUI):
Visualize the battle strategies and simulations dynamically.

2. Custom Algorithms:
Implement pathfinding algorithms like A*, Dijkstra.
